StoragErazor automatically removes data stored in DOM Storage (local storage) and IndexedDB when the browser restarts. Some websites use these databases as super-cookies to track users. 

There is also a browser action icon with a menu which lets you erase these databases manually.

The addon does not touch the IndexedDB databases created by other addons, only those which were created by websites.

Available on AMO here: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/storagerazor/

Firefox 57 (57.0b3 or higher)is required for this addon to work.

If you don't use Firefox 57 you can only delete IndexedDB super-cookies manually from the storage/ folder inside your Firefox profile folder.
